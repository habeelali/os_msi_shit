CPU consumptions I/O wait -- CPU utilization = (1 - P^n)

What is Kernel
-core part of an operating system
-bridge between applications and the physical hardware
-handling system resources like CPU, memory, and device management
-Prevents unauthorized access

Zombie Process 
-Process that completed the execution but still have entry in the memory

Process Scheduling
-FCFS SJF non-preemptive
-SRTF RR preemptive
Response time = Start time -  Arrival time
T.A.T = Completion - arrival time 
Wait time =  T.A.T - Burst Time 


PIPES
-UnNamed Pipes for parent child communication
-Named Pipes for communication of random processes

THREADS
-Threads Multiprogramming by context switching (not true parallelism)
-Threads use the same memory as of their calling processes
-Multiprocessing different processes in different cores simultaneously (true parallelism) 
-Context Switch process switching following scheduling algorithms


THREAD Synchronization 

Semaphores
-Allowing multiple threads to access multiple resources at a time
-can be unlocaked by any thread
-no ownership

Binary Semaphores
-Thread synchronization tool
-Used to control access to a shared resource
-Allowing only one at a time
-Commonly used for mutual exclusion
-no ownership 

Mutex
-Synchronization primitive similar to a binary semaphore but is more restrictive
-Allowing only one thread to hold the "lock" on a resource at any time
-Prevents other threads from locking it until the first thread is done.

Process Control Block 
-It is a data structure managed by OS containing process information e.g.
-process state, process id, scheduling info ect

Replicated ls | ls -l | LAB7

-Pages
one partition in main memory => Frame
same partition in secondary memory => Page
SizeOfPage = SizeOfFrame
virtual address to physical address
bit to represent page/frame offset/size, frame no, page no

-Page Replacement strategies 
FIFO
LRU
OPTIMAL the best but can't implement

---Dead Lock
--4 conditions to occur simultaneously
-mutual exclusion only one thread at a time
-hold and wait
-no preemption
-circular wait

--DeadLock Identifcation

-Synchronization 
Producer Consumer LAB using Semaphores and mutex
Disable interrupts during semaphore operations
Signal Blocking (SIGVTALARM)
Signal masking
Safe Sequence Dead Lock Avoidance
Disabling interrupts during Semaphore Operations

-Persistent Management 
hard links and soft links
-Inode -> metadata USP BOOK page 200
Direct pointers
single pointers -> direct pointers
double pointers -> single pointers -> direct pointers
double pointers -> single pointers -> direct pointers
Triple pointers -> double pointers -> single pointers -> direct pointers
